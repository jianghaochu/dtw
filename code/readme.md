Q & A:

+ Name of the new algorithm: Time-dependent Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TD-WDTW)

+ For self-defined window function, there are no path differences across different DTW algorithms but differences exist across varying window size. Is it what we expected? More details to be discussed.

+ Default window type for dpcore_window is sakoeChibaWindow

+ Require further test on different datasets
