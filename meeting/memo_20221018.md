Notation:

+ Observation: a collection of data points for one object



Step 1: Find the best matches

1. classic matching (MatchIt)
   
   + [CRAN - Package MatchIt](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MatchIt/index.html)
   
   + Inputs: observation features (cross sectional data)
   
   + Outputs: test-control pairs (1-1 matching, 1-n matching)

2. dynamic time wrapping (dtw)
   
   + [CRAN - Package dtw](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dtw/index.html)
   
   + [Dynamic time warping (DTW) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmZlBIcArwhMJoGk5zpiRlkaHUqy5dLzL)
   
   + Inputs: observation sequence (time-series data)
   
   + Ouputs: test-control pairs (1-1 matching, 1-n matching)
     
     + Find the pairs of most similar sequences

3. synthetic control
   
   + Simple example:
     
     + Find weights for observations from the control group using OLS; treat sales in pre-period ~ control sales 1 in pre-period + control sales 2 in pre-period
     
     + Verify the robustness of weights using out-of-sample tests based on the metric of MAPE
     
     + Predict the counterfactual value of the treated in post-period
     
     + causal effect = observed value - predicted counterfactual value

   + R package: [CRAN - Package wfe](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wfe/index.html)

Step 2: Causal Impact

+ [CRAN - Package CausalImpact](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CausalImpact/index.html)

+ Inputs: test-control pairs

+ Outputs: causal impacts
  
  + User case reference: https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html



Goal

+ Example: MarketMatching [[R Package Vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MarketMatching/vignettes/MarketMatching-Vignette.html)]
  
  > The `MarketMatching` package implements the workflow described above by essentially providing an easy-to-use “wrapper” for the `dtw` and `CausalImpact`.
  > 
  > + Use MAPE as a metric to find the best-matching results

+ Contributions
  
  + Combine different methods (from classic methods to newly developed methods)
  
  + Evaluate the performance of best controls based on different methods
    
    + Note that MAPE is a proper metric to evaluate the fitness of two sequences (like R-sq) but not a good metric to check the parallel trend
  
  + Placebo tests
