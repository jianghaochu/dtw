### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) Feature Descriptor

A feature descriptor is a representation of an image or an image patch that simplifies the image by extracting useful information and throwing away extraneous information. Typically, a feature descriptor converts an image of size width $\times$ height $\times$ 3 (channels ) to a feature vector / array of length $n$. In the case of the HOG feature descriptor, the input image is of size $64 \times 128 \times 3$ and the output feature vector is of length 3780.
